# Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the Rust HTTP Server on your local machine.
Prerequisites

* Rust (version 1.82.0 or higher)

To check your Rust installation, run:

```bash
$ rustc --version
```


# Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/GArmane/rust-http-server.git
$ cd rust-http-server
```

2. Run tests to ensure the server works as expected:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

3. Build project with cargo:

```bash
$ cargo build --release
```

# Usage

To start the server, run:

```bash
$ cargo run
```

The server will start on 127.0.0.1:7878 by default. You can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to http://127.0.0.1:7878.

## Example

Once the server is running, it can serve static HTML files placed in a predefined directory (e.g., ./public). For example, placing an index.html file in the public directory will make it accessible at http://127.0.0.1:7878/index.html.

# Configuration

To change the port or host address, update the code in main.rs:
```rust
let address = "127.0.0.1:7878";
```
You can also extend the serverâ€™s functionality by adding more route handlers or response types.
